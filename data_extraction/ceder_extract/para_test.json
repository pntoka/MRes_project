["Synthesis of CDs was prepared using a hydrothermal method by referencing to previous work with some changes. 3-amino-4-chlorophenylboronic acid (0.3428 g) and 3-aminobenzeneboronic acid (0.2739 g) was dissolved in 20 mL distilled water and sonicated for 2 min, respectively. Then transferred to autoclave reactor and heated at 200 °C for 10 h to prepare ClBNCDs and BNCDs. 178 μL of benzene and 183 μL of aniline were dissolved in 20 mL distilled water in an autoclave reactor, respectively. Then, heated at 200 °C for 10 h to prepare free-doping and N-doping CDs, respectively. Then, the supernatant was pretreated for 24 h using the dialysis bag with a molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of 3500 Da. Finally, CDs products were obtained and stored at 4 °C for subsequent processes."]
